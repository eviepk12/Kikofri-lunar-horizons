As June rolls around, the topic of Pride Month has circulated everyones news cycle, whether it be positive or negative. It can't be ignored though how the mainstream image of "Pride Month", largerly revolves around celebrations in western nations i.e America, Netherlands, UK, etc etc.  

While this image is not inherently *wrong*, it does create a western-centric view of queer culture and development that can be quite damaging. Not only to westerners which creates a false image that queers **only** exists in the west and even creates an orientalist view of queers around the world, it can also be damaging to queers in non western nations that makes them feel isolated and lonely in a seemingly more and more violent and hostile society towards queer people.  

I know my experience as a young queer person feeling isolated, lonely, seeing the pride marches abroad, how they seem to be more accepting than what I experience in my own home. It made me jealous, bitter even, to my friends abroad that can express and live life in a way that I can't even imagine myself doing in my wildest dreams.

But what if I told you that the first government to fully legalize same-sex marriage is not the Netherlands like what many of us knows, but it's actually an archipelago nation in the far flungs of the pacific... Well... technically, but hear my out!!

## (A bit) of Background

Well ok, technically that's not *true*. What I'm talking about, is the *Communist Party of the Philippines* 1998 document "**On the Proletarian Relationship of the Sexes**"µ#[1](http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article44637)#µ which states :

> **E. On Same-sex relationships**
1. The Party recognizes the right of each individual member to choose their gender or sex.
2. The basic principles and guidelines for marriage inside the Party are applicable to their case.

These short lines that ammended the previous document "**On the Relation of Sexes**" that codifies relationships within the movement, officially recognizes relationships of "homosexual relations" within the party.

Making the territories held by the CPP/NPA and the governmental bodies it makes up *technically* speaking the *first* to recognize same sex marriage in the world.

While of course this is not what we usually mean when we think of "legalization", the story of how LGBTQ+ rights in the Philippines and its role in radical activism developed is an important story in queer history. Not only is it an important history for us to learn, it's also an ongoing struggle for human rights, dignity, and the liberation of all opressed people of diverse identities in the so called "*third world*".

While this article will not be doing a deep analysis on this particular document and it's evolution throughout the years because that is **beyond** not only the scope of this article but also the scope of my own knowledge. But if you are interested in learning more I **highly** recommend reading :
