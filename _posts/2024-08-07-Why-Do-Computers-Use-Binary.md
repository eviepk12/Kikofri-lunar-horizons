As all year 0 computer science students knows, the first thing you learn in class is the Binary System - what it is, how it works, etc etc - but have you ever wondered **why**?. Why do computers even use it? why can't it just be normal and use the decimal system like the rest of us? why do I need to know how to convert decimals to binary and vice vers?and most importantly why do **WE** use the decimal system?.
