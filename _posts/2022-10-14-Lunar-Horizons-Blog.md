## Who am I?

Hi!, Welcome to my little corner of the internet!. I’m a software engineering student that is always interested in expanding my horizon and knowledge. Though I’m always open minded to learn about anything, the particular topics that I have been consistently interested in are :

- Computer Science
- Urban Planning
- Science Fiction
- Grand Strategy Games
- Philosophy
- History

## What to expect

This blog will be a place where I put my thoughts on topics, opinions, and just general ramblings I have for my own intellectual journey, and I hope I can bring you along in this journey!.

> Complacency is the enemy of study. We cannot really learn anything until we rid ourselves of complacency. Our attitude towards ourselves should be “to be insatiable in learning”, and towards others “to be tireless in teaching”.
