## ..myself #

Halo!, I am a software engineering student with an appetite for knowledge and even bigger appetite for boba... all in all, I'm your run on the mill STEM student with an interest in social studies, especially politics and philosophy.

## ...my publications #

Most of the articles and other publications I will post here will go in the following categories :

- Politics
- Philosophy
- Tech
- History

## ...this theme #

This theme is based off the <a href="https://github.com/kxxvii/Kikofri" style="color: #800000;"> Kikofri</a> theme. I cannot stress how perfect this theme is for the style I'm going for without the stress of designing my own theme from scratch and I can just focus on deployment and making more content!.
